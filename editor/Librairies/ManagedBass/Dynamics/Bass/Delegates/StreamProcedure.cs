    /// <param name="Buffer">The pointer to the Buffer to write the sample data in. The sample data must be written in standard Windows PCM format - 8-bit samples are unsigned, 16-bit samples are signed, 32-bit floating-point samples range from -1 to 1.</param>

    /// <para>A stream writing function should obviously be as quick as possible, because other streams (and MOD musics) can't be updated until it's finished.</para>
    /// <para>It is better to return less data quickly, rather than spending a long time delivering the amount BASS requested.</para>
    /// <para>Although a STREAMPROC may return less data than BASS requests, be careful not to do so by too much, too often. If the Buffer level gets too low, BASS will automatically stall playback of the stream, until the whole Buffer has refilled.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="Bass.ChannelGetData(int,IntPtr,int)" /> <see cref="DataFlags"/> can be used to check the Buffer level, and <see cref="Bass.ChannelIsActive" /> can be used to check if playback has stalled.</para>
    /// <para>A <see cref="SyncFlags.Stalled"/> sync can also be set via <see cref="Bass.ChannelSetSync" />, to be triggered upon playback stalling or resuming.</para>
    /// <para>If you do return less than the requested amount of data, the number of bytes should still equate to a whole number of samples.</para>

    /// It is clever to NOT alloc Buffer data (e.g. a float[]) everytime within the callback method, since ALL callbacks should be really fast!
    /// And if you would do a 'float[] data = new float[]' every time here...the GarbageCollector would never really clean up that memory.
    /// Sideeffects might occure, due to the fact, that BASS will call this callback too fast and too often...
    /// However, this is not always the case, so in most examples it'll work just fine - but if you got problems - try moving any memory allocation things outside any callbacks.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>NOTE: When you pass an instance of a callback delegate to one of the BASS functions, this delegate object will not be reference counted. 
    /// This means .NET would not know, that it might still being used by BASS. The Garbage Collector might (re)move the delegate instance, if the variable holding the delegate is not declared as global.
